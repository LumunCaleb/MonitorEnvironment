Here is a repository to host my streamlit application script and all other depenencies
In this repository, all the files required for deployment of the web app have been uploaded.

Also, a step by step guide on deploting a web app with streamlit with appropriate images has also been uploaded with the file name DeployingonStramlit.doc

encoder.joblib is the file containing codes for encoding of the dataset

script.py contains the web app python script

knnmainnew_model.joblib contains the trained model

requirements.txt contains all the dependencis used in the script

scalar.joblib contains codes used to scale the data set

With the above you can be able to reproduce a similar web app.
